                        I don't remember it, at any rate. But apparently
                        setting the margin property "auto" will
                        automatically horizontally center the element
                        within its container. So, for example, since
                        the element with the .card class is within the
                        body container element, the card gets centered
                        on the page. And I think that's great. */
  /* margin-top: 38px; Here I was trying to get white (background)

                        somewhat large, random number. It didn't
                        affect anything.*/

  /* margin: 8px; Here I was trying to use a typical shorthand margin
                  all the way around. In fact, the solution indicates
                  I should stop writing "in fact" so much in code
                  comments. Nah, I'm just kidding, I'll try not to take
                  myself so seriously. Writing in long, journal-like
                  sentences helps me be sure I'm actually thinking
                  things through.
                  Anyway, I'm about to save this and then step through
                  the longhand margin properties as laid out in the
